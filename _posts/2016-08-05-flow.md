## Introduction
Flow is a static type checker for JavaScript. It can be used to catch common bugs in JavaScript programs before they run, including:<br/>
* silent type conversions,   
* null dereferences,   
* and the dreaded undefined is not a function.  
 
Flow also powers advanced features for editors, including Vim, Emacs, and Nuclide.
